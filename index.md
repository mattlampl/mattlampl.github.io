### Project 3: Spot the Bot - Developing a Twitter Bot Detection Algorithm
Defined as automated accounts that can post, like, retweet, and follow other users, social bots have become a major concern for social media platforms and their users. As technology advances, it has become increasingly difficult for social media users to discern content generated by bots from content generated by humans. In turn, this can make it more difficult for users to critically evaluate bot-generated content, increasing the potential for misinformation.

### Project 4: To Bee or Not to Bee
To what extent do factors such as the usage of various pesticides, rainfall, temperature, and more impact the number of honeybee colonies as well as honey yield? In modeling honeybee colony decline, can we effectively predict and simulate honeybee production in a given state and/or region?
